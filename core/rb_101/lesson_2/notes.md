Short Circuiting: the && and || operators exhibit a behavior called short circuiting, which means it will stop evaluating expressions once it can guarantee the return value.

&& Short circuits on false, || short circuits on true

There are two layers to solving any problem: 
1. Logical problem layer
2. Syntax programming language layer
